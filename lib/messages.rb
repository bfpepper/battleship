    "You are playing against a very simple computer.

    Both you and the comuter will place your ships on the given board.

    Once all the ships are palced both you and the computer will take turns making
    guesses where the other's ships are.  Guesses are made using grid positions, similar
    to how you placed your ships on the board.

    the game is over once either you or the comuter has successfully sunk the
    opponent's ships.

    Good luck and have fun!\n\n"
